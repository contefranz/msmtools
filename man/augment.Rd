\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} object in longitudinal
format where each row represents an observation in which the exact starting
and ending time of the process are known and recorded. If \code{data} is a
\code{data.frame}, then \code{augment} internally casts it to a \code{data.table}.}

\item{data_key}{A keying variable which \code{augment} uses to define a key
for \code{data}. This represents the subject ID (see
\code{\link[data.table]{setkey}}).}

\item{n_events}{An integer variable indicating the progressive (monotonic)
event number of a given ID. \code{augment} always checks whether
\code{n_events} is monotonic increasing within the provided \code{data_key}
and stops the execution in case the check fails (see 'Details').
If missing, \code{augment} fastly creates a variable named \code{"n_events"}.}

\item{pattern}{Either an integer, a factor or a character with 2 or 3 unique
values which provides the ID status at the end of the study. \code{pattern}
has a predefined structure. When 2 values are detected, they must be in the
format: 0 = "alive", 1 = "dead". When 3 values are detected, then the format
must be: 0 = "alive", 1 = "dead during a transition", 2 = "dead after a
transition has ended" (see 'Details').}

\item{state}{A list of three and exactly three possible states which a
subject can reach. \code{state} has a predefined structure as follows:
IN, OUT, DEAD (see 'Details').}

\item{t_start}{The starting time of an observation. It can be passed as date,
integer, or numeric format.}

\item{t_end}{The ending time of an observation. It can be passed as date,
integer, or numeric format.}

\item{t_cens}{The censoring time of the study. This is the date until each
ID is observed, if still active in the cohort.}

\item{t_death}{The exact death time of a subject ID. If \code{t_death} is
missing, \code{t_cens} is assumed to contain both censoring and death times
and a warning is raised.}

\item{t_augmented}{A variable indicating the name of the new time variable
of the process in the augmented format. If \code{t_augmented} is missing,
then the default name 'augmented' is assumed and the corresponding new
variable is added to \code{data}. \code{t_augmented} is cast to integer
or to numeric depending whether \code{t_start} is a date or a difftime,
respectively. The suffix '_int' or '_num' is pasted to \code{t_augmented}
and a new variable is computed accordingly.
This is done because \code{\link[msm]{msm}} can't correctly deal with date
or difftime variables. Both variables are positioned before \code{t_start}.}

\item{more_status}{A variable which marks further transitions beside the
default ones given by \code{state}. \code{more_status} can be a factor or a
character (see 'Details'). If missing, \code{augment} ignores it.}

\item{check_NA}{If \code{TRUE}, then arguments \code{data_key},
\code{n_events}, \code{pattern}, \code{t_start} and \code{t_end} are looked
up for any missing data and if the function finds any, it stops with error.
Default is \code{FALSE} because \code{augment} is not intended for
running consistency checks, beside what is mandatory, and because the
procedure is computationally onerous and could cause memory overhead for
very large datasets. Argument \code{more_status} is the only one for which
\code{augment} always checks for the presence of missing data and, again,
if it finds any it just stops with error.}

\item{convert}{If \code{TRUE}, then the returned object is automatically
converted to the class \code{data.frame}. This is done in place and comes
at very low cost both from running time and memory consumption
(see \code{\link[data.table]{setDF}}).}

\item{verbose}{If \code{FALSE}, all information produced by \code{print},
\code{cat} and \code{message} are suppressed. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An augmented format dataset of class \code{data.table}, or
\code{data.frame} when \code{convert} is \code{TRUE}, where each row
represents a specific transition for a given subject. \code{augment} returns
them after some important variables have been computed:\cr

\item{\code{augmented}}{The new timing variable for the process when looking
at transitions. If \code{t_augmented} is missing, then \code{augment} creates
\emph{augmented} by default. \emph{augmented}. The function looks directly
to \code{t_start} and \code{t_end} to build it and thus it inherits their class.
In particular, if \code{t_start} is a date format, then \code{augment}
computes a new variable cast as integer and names it \emph{augmented_int}.
If \code{t_start} is a difftime format, then \code{augment} computes a new
variable cast as a numeric and names it \emph{augmented_num.}}
\item{\code{status}}{A status flag which contains the states as specified
in \code{state}. \code{augment} automatically checks whether argument
\code{pattern} has 2 or 3 unique values and computes the correct structure
of a given subject as reported in the vignette. The variable is cast as
character.}
\item{\code{status_num}}{The corresponding integer version of \emph{status}.}
\item{\code{n_status}}{A mix of \code{status} and \code{n_events} cast as
character. This becomes useful when a multi-state model on the progression
of the process needs to be implemented.}

If \code{more_status} is passed, then \code{augment} computes some more
variables. They mimic the meaning of \emph{status}, \emph{status_num},
and \emph{n_status} but they account for the more complex structure defined.
They are: \code{status_exp}, \code{status_exp_num}, and \code{n_status_exp}.

\description{
A fast and general method for reshaping standard longitudinal data into a new
structure called augmented'. This format is suitable under a multi-state
framework using the \code{\link[msm]{msm}} package.
}
\details{
In order to get the data processed, a monotonic increasing process
needs to be ensured. In the first place, \code{augment} checks this both in
case \code{n_events} is missing or not. The data are efficiently ordered through
\code{\link[data.table]{setkey}} function with \code{data_key} as the primary
key and \code{t_start} as the secondary key. In the second place, it checks
the monotonicity of \code{n_events} and if it fails, it stops with error and
returns the subjects given by \code{data_key} for whom the condition is not
met. If \code{n_events} is missing, then \code{augment} internally computes
the progression number with the name \emph{n_events} and runs the same
procedure.

Attention needs to be payed to argument \code{pattern}. Integer values can
be 0 and 1 if only two status are defined and they must correspond to the
status 'alive' and 'dead'. If three values are defined, then they must be 0,
1 and 2 if \code{pattern} is an integer, or 'alive', 'dead inside a
transition' and dead outside a transition' if \code{pattern} is either a
character or a factor. The order matters: it is not possible to specify
0 as 'dead' for instance.

When passing a list of states, the order is important so that the first
element must be the state corresponding to the starting time
(i.e. 'IN', inside the hospital), the second element must correspond
to the ending time (i.e. 'OUT', outside the hospital), and the third state
is the absorbing state (i.e. 'DEAD').

\code{more_status} allows to manage multiple transitions beside what already
specified in \code{state}. In particular, if the corresponding observation
is a standard admission which adds no other information than what is inside
\code{state}, then \code{more_status} must be set to 'df' which stands for
'Default' (see 'Examples' or run ?hosp and look at the variable 'rehab_it').
In general, it is always a good practice to fully specify the transition
with a bunch of self-explanatory characters in order to quickly understand
which is the current transition.
